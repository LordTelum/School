Added some dragon concept sketches. One is a very simple cute design and the other is a slightly more detailed one.

The Robot arm is a cupcake decorator. It will grab a cupcake from one conveyor belt, move it to the table in front of it, rotate it's arm to the frosting nozzle, add frosting, switch back to the claw, then move the cupcake to the next conveyor belt.

The robot arm's base is in the shape of a cupcake and the end of the arm is able to rodate between a frosting nozzle and claw for moving and decorating the cupcakes.

Finished modeling the Robot arm, Had some trouble with the hands but scrapped my original idea for somehting a little more simple but I think it gave the robot a little more character.
